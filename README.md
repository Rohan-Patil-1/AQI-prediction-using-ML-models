# NLP-Project-Intermediate
This repository contains the code and data for an intermediate-level natural language processing (NLP) project on optimizing machine learning models for toxic comment classification. The project uses a hyperparameter tuning approach to improve the performance of machine learning model and algorithm on a dataset of toxic and non-toxic comments.
